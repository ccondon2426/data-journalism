Storing key for ARCOS access.

```{r}
# store one of our API keys as an object called key
key <- "uO4EK6I"
```

Loading ARCOS county data.

```{r}

#arcos_county_pills_per_year <- summarized_county_annual(key = key) %>%
 # clean_names()

#phamarcy_pill_totals <- combined_buyer_annual(county = "Mingo", state = "WV", key = key) %>%
  #clean_names()

#pharmacy_census_tract <- pharm_tracts(key = key) %>%
  #clean_names()

#tracts_pills_per_year <- pharmacy_pill_totals  %>%
#inner_join(phamarcy_census_tract, by = "buyer_dea_no")
 
```

#The join is not working because the object I created for each of the pharmacies in Mingo County is "not found".I cannot determine the reason for this error. Once I figure out how to complete this join, I will have the pharmacies in this Census tract and the number of pills each one received. Then, I will use the crosswalk csv to connect the census tracts with CoCs, and then I can begin my analysis.


Loading crosswalk.

```{r}
crosswalk <- read_csv("data/crosswalk-coc-to-tract.csv")
```

#In the meantime, I will answer questions I feel will be helfpul dor my analysis in the future. See below.
