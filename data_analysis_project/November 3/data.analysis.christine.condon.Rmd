Joining total 2010 population and total pills.
```{r}
#
coc_crosswalk_x <- coc_crosswalk %>%
  left_join(tract_pills, by=c("tract_fips" = "GEOID")) %>%
  group_by(coc_code, coc_name, state_code) %>%

```

Filtering for one year.

```{r}
pit_count_2014 <- pit_count %>%
select(coc_code, coc_name, ends_with("_2014"))
```

Now I want to join this with 'coc_crosswalk_x' so I can compare PIT count and pills per person

```{r}
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person <- coc_crosswalk_x %>%
  inner_join(pit_count_2014, by = "coc_code") %>%
  select(coc_code, total_2010_population, total_pills, overall_homeless_2014) %>%
  mutate(pills_per_person = (total_pills/total_2010_population)) %>%
 mutate(homelessness_rate = (overall_homeless_2014/total_2010_population)) %>%
  arrange(desc(homelessness_rate))

```

Now I have a dataframe that shows me homelessness rate by coc as well as the amount of pills person they received, on average, between 2006 and 2012 (based on 2010 census population figures).

First, I'd like to see if there's any kind of correlation here. 

Question 1: Correlation between homelessness rate and pills per capita 2014?
```{r}
# Test correlations
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(pills_per_person, homelessness_rate) %>%
  cor()

cor.test(homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$pills_per_person, homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$homelessness_rate)
```
Since the p value is greater than .05, the correlation is not statistically significant.

Question 2: Correlation between sheltered homelessness rate and pills per capita 2014? (Sheltered numbers tend to be more reliable)

```{r}
#Bringing in sheltered data instead.
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person <- coc_crosswalk_x %>%
  inner_join(pit_count_2014, by = "coc_code") %>%
  select(coc_code, total_2010_population, total_pills, sheltered_total_homeless_2014) %>%
  mutate(pills_per_person = (total_pills/total_2010_population)) %>%
 mutate(sheltered_homelessness_rate = (sheltered_total_homeless_2014/total_2010_population)) %>%
  arrange(desc(sheltered_homelessness_rate))

```

```{r}
# Test correlation
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(pills_per_person, sheltered_homelessness_rate) %>%
  cor()

cor.test(homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$pills_per_person, homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$sheltered_homelessness_rate)
```
Since the p value is greater than .05, the correlation is not statistically significant.

Question 3: Correlation between unsheltered homelessness rate and pills per capita 2014?

```{r}
#Bringing in unsheltered data instead
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person <- coc_crosswalk_x %>%
  inner_join(pit_count_2014, by = "coc_code") %>%
  select(coc_code, total_2010_population, total_pills, unsheltered_homeless_2014) %>%
  mutate(pills_per_person = (total_pills/total_2010_population)) %>%
 mutate(unsheltered_homelessness_rate = (unsheltered_homeless_2014/total_2010_population)) %>%
  arrange(desc(unsheltered_homelessness_rate))

```

```{r}
# Test correlation
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(pills_per_person, unsheltered_homelessness_rate) %>%
  cor()

cor.test(homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$pills_per_person, homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$unsheltered_homelessness_rate)
```
The p value is less than .05, the correlation is statistically significant!!

Question 4: Correlation between veterans homelessness rate and pills per capita 2014?

```{r}

#Bringing in the veterans data instead
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person <- coc_crosswalk_x %>%
  inner_join(pit_count_2014, by = "coc_code") %>%
  select(coc_code, total_2010_population, total_pills, homeless_veterans_2014) %>%
  mutate(pills_per_person = (total_pills/total_2010_population)) %>%
 mutate(vets_homelessness_rate = (homeless_veterans_2014/total_2010_population)) %>%
  arrange(desc(vets_homelessness_rate))

```

```{r}
# Test correlation
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(pills_per_person, vets_homelessness_rate) %>%
  cor()

cor.test(homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$pills_per_person, homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$vets_homelessness_rate)
```
Since the p value is greater than .05, the correlation is not statistically significant.

Question 5: Correlation between chronic homelessness and pills per capita 2014?

```{r}
#Bringing in the chronic data instead
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person <- coc_crosswalk_x %>%
  inner_join(pit_count_2014, by = "coc_code") %>%
  select(coc_code, total_2010_population, total_pills, chronically_homeless_2014) %>%
  mutate(pills_per_person = (total_pills/total_2010_population)) %>%
 mutate(chronic_homelessness_rate = (chronically_homeless_2014/total_2010_population)) %>%
  arrange(desc(chronic_homelessness_rate))

```

```{r}
# Test correlation
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(pills_per_person, chronic_homelessness_rate) %>%
  cor()

cor.test(homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$pills_per_person, homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$chronic_homelessness_rate)
```
The p value is less than .05, the correlation is statistically significant!!

Question 6: Let's try a different year, since it may have taken a bit for pill shipments to impact homelessness. So now let's see if there's any correlation between the homelessness rate and pills per person rate in 2017, for example.

```{r}
pit_count_2017 <- pit_count %>%
select(coc_code, coc_name, ends_with("_2017"))
```

```{r}
#Modifying original object so that it's 2017 data instead of 2014 data.
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person <- coc_crosswalk_x %>%
  inner_join(pit_count_2017, by = "coc_code") %>%
  select(coc_code, total_2010_population, total_pills, overall_homeless_2017) %>%
  mutate(pills_per_person = (total_pills/total_2010_population)) %>%
 mutate(homelessness_rate = (overall_homeless_2017/total_2010_population)) %>%
  arrange(desc(homelessness_rate))

```

```{r}
# Test correlation
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(pills_per_person, homelessness_rate) %>%
  cor()

cor.test(homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$pills_per_person, homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$homelessness_rate)
```
Since the p value is greater than .05, the correlation is not statistically significant.

Question 7: Correlation between sheltered homelessness rate in 2017 and pills per capita?

```{r}
#Bringing in the sheltered 2017 data instead 
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person <- coc_crosswalk_x %>%
  inner_join(pit_count_2017, by = "coc_code") %>%
  select(coc_code, total_2010_population, total_pills, sheltered_total_homeless_2017) %>%
  mutate(pills_per_person = (total_pills/total_2010_population)) %>%
 mutate(sheltered_homelessness_rate = (sheltered_total_homeless_2017/total_2010_population)) %>%
  arrange(desc(sheltered_homelessness_rate))

```

```{r}
# Test correlation
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(pills_per_person, sheltered_homelessness_rate) %>%
  cor()

cor.test(homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$pills_per_person, homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$sheltered_homelessness_rate)
```
Since the p value is greater than .05, the correlation is not statistically significant.

Question 8: Correlation between unsheltered homelessness rate in 2017 and pills per capita?
```{r}
#Bringing in the unsheltered 2017 data
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person <- coc_crosswalk_x %>%
  inner_join(pit_count_2017, by = "coc_code") %>%
  select(coc_code, total_2010_population, total_pills, unsheltered_homeless_2017) %>%
  mutate(pills_per_person = (total_pills/total_2010_population)) %>%
 mutate(unsheltered_homelessness_rate = (unsheltered_homeless_2017/total_2010_population)) %>%
  arrange(desc(unsheltered_homelessness_rate))

```

```{r}
# Test correlation
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(pills_per_person, unsheltered_homelessness_rate) %>%
  cor()

cor.test(homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$pills_per_person, homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$unsheltered_homelessness_rate)
```
The p value is less than .05, the correlation is statistically significant!!

Question 9: Correlation between veterans homelessness in 2017 and pills per capita?
```{r}
#Bringing in the vets 2017 data instead
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person <- coc_crosswalk_x %>%
  inner_join(pit_count_2017, by = "coc_code") %>%
  select(coc_code, total_2010_population, total_pills, homeless_veterans_2017) %>%
  mutate(pills_per_person = (total_pills/total_2010_population)) %>%
 mutate(vets_homelessness_rate = (homeless_veterans_2017/total_2010_population)) %>%
  arrange(desc(vets_homelessness_rate))

```

```{r}
# Test correlation
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(pills_per_person, vets_homelessness_rate) %>%
  cor()

cor.test(homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$pills_per_person, homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$vets_homelessness_rate)
```
Since the p value is greater than .05, the correlation is not statistically significant.

Question 10: Correlation between chronic homelessness in 2017 and pills per capita?
```{r}
#Bringing in the chronic 2017 data instead
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person <- coc_crosswalk_x %>%
  inner_join(pit_count_2017, by = "coc_code") %>%
  select(coc_code, total_2010_population, total_pills, chronically_homeless_2017) %>%
  mutate(pills_per_person = (total_pills/total_2010_population)) %>%
 mutate(chronic_homelessness_rate = (chronically_homeless_2017/total_2010_population)) %>%
  arrange(desc(chronic_homelessness_rate))

```

```{r}
# Test correlation
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(pills_per_person, chronic_homelessness_rate) %>%
  cor()

cor.test(homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$pills_per_person, homelessness_rate_pills_per_person$chronic_homelessness_rate)
```
The p value is less than .05, the correlation is statistically significant!!

Question 11: It may be interesting to compare opioid death rates with pit count numbers. Let's bring in that data. Then, I'll assess whether there's a correlation.
```{r}
#Bringing back overall homeless numbers
homelessness_rate_pills_per_person <- coc_crosswalk_x %>%
  inner_join(pit_count_2017, by = "coc_code") %>%
  select(coc_code, total_2010_population, total_pills, overall_homeless_2017) %>%
  mutate(pills_per_person = (total_pills/total_2010_population)) %>%
 mutate(homelessness_rate = (overall_homeless_2017/total_2010_population)) %>%
  arrange(desc(homelessness_rate))

```

```{r}
#brining in death rates

opioid_death_rates <- read.delim("data/2006-2012.txt")

#The death rates are organized by county, so I'll want to compare them with CoCs that are also counties. Many of the CoCs in Maryland, for example, are counties, so let's start there.

#Only Maryland CoCs that received pills
homelessness_rate_opioid_deaths <- homelessness_rate_pills_per_person %>%
  select(coc_code, coc_name.x, homelessness_rate) %>%
  dplyr::filter(grepl("md", coc_code))

#Eliminating the Maryland CoC that received pills but is NOT a sinlge county
homelessness_rate_opioid_deaths <- homelessness_rate_opioid_deaths[-c(2),]

#Manually add county codes to CoCs to allow you to join in the opiod death rates
county_code <- c('24031','24013','24025', '24003','24033','24027','24023')
homelessness_rate_opioid_deaths['county_code'] <- county_code

#Cleaning up before join
opioid_death_rates <- opioid_death_rates %>%
  clean_names()
homelessness_rate_opioid_deaths[, c(4)] <- sapply(homelessness_rate_opioid_deaths[, c(4)], as.numeric)

#Joining
homeless_opioid_deaths <- homelessness_rate_opioid_deaths %>%
inner_join(opioid_death_rates, by = "county_code") %>%

  ungroup() %>%
  select(homelessness_rate, crude_rate) %>%
  cor()

cor.test(homeless_opioid_deaths$homelessness_rate, homeless_opioid_deaths$crude_rate)

```
Since the p value is greater than .05, the correlation is not statistically significant.

Question 12: Correlation between opioid death rate and sheltered homelessness rate in MD counties?

```{r}
